 *   SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR -> manages the PLATFORM only
 *   EMPLOYER             -> owns the ORGANIZATION and its HR environment
 *   HR EXPERT            -> RECORDS / PROCESSES / SUBMITS
 *   HR MANAGER           -> VIEWS / REVIEWS / APPROVES / SUPERVISES
 *   EMPLOYEE             -> uses employee HR services for themselves
 *   CANDIDATE            -> participates in recruitment
